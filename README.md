# Genomic epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2: Teaching notes for Genome Hackers 2020.

These are the teaching notes for the session. For each vignette, click on the title to go to link to the picture of trees we'll be discussing :)

###[An early picture: Viruses from China at the beginning of the epidemic.](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/2020-01-25?d=tree&f_country=China&m=div)

* What does the X axis tell you?
* How many mutations different is Wuhan/WIV06/2019 from Wuhan/IPBCAMS-WH-02/2019?
* How many mutations different is Wuhan/WIV06/2019 from Guangdong/20SF014/2020?
_Discussion_: What the genomic data told us early on about the potential for human-to-human transmission.

###[The rate of virus evolution, and estimating when events occur.](https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?l=clock)


* What does the X axis represent?
* What does the Y axis represent?
* What does the line going through the dots tell us?
_Discussion_: How the rate of evolution allows us to make trees that not only show genetic divergence, but actually show temporal information and the samples and about the epidemic. Special note about how this helps us understand when the epidemic started.

###[Adding additional epidemiologic information to the tree: practical example!](https://nextstrain.org/community/alliblk/genhack-camp/ncov/washington?c=reported-residence-type)

* Click on the title of this vignette to go to a picture of a tree.
* Then, download [this file of fictional epi data](./toy-metadata.tsv).
* Once you have the view of the tree open, drag and drop the file on the webpage.
_Dicussion_: We'll explore the patterns of the additional data on the tree, and think about what they tell us about transmission.
